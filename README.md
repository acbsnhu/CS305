# CS305

    Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, 
    and their software requirements. Who was the client? 
    What issue did they want you to address?
        In this project I assumed a role on Global Rain development team. In this
    project the team was to take on the client Artemis Fincial and oversee the fincial
    institue modernize their operations and make them more secure. Artemis Fincial has 
    accounts with clients ranging from individual plans to company or even some government
    plans. We had to address the problem of anazying and idetifying security vulnerabilities 
    in there code. We did this mainly by implenting a vulnerability assessment report, reading
    the report generated and finalizing documentation on what was found and how to fix.
    
    
    What did you do very well when you found your client’s software 
    security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? 
    What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
        I was able to successfully implement static testing in the code 
    which assisted me in identifying current vulnerabilities that were
    hiding in the code base. It is very important to code securley because
    it helps prevent data from being stolen by threat actors. Secure code also
    limits the holes in software by keeping vulnerabilities to a minimum. The value
    a company gains to there well being is one piece of mind knowing that they are 
    doing everything they can to protect their data. Also it helps to protect the 
    overall reputation and shows them as reliable when they have good security
    protecting there customers data. 
    
    What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
        I foudn the dependency check tool very helpful saving me time in
     detecting vulnerabilities. This static testing I performed was able to 
     scan the code and find in minutes that would have taken me much longer 
     to find by manually checking every dependcey and was most likey more
     accurate also.
    
    How did you increase layers of security? In the future, 
    what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which 
    mitigation techniques to use?
        I would continue the use of the depency test to find vulnerabilties.
    But in the future along side this I would also like to implement 
    penetration testing to better access weakpoints that maybe the static testing
    didn't catch. I increased layers of security by suggesting a mitigation
    plan that would help fix holes in the security. Some of my fixes would be 
    implmenting https and updating to the most recent versions of the integrated tools
    and software inside the code. 
    
    How did you make certain the code and software application were 
    functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check 
    to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
        I continually ran debug to ensure the software was functional when
     I implmented any changes. I would also run a vulnerability test before
     any changes were made so that I would ahve a base line to compare to. Then
     I would also check with another vulnerability test after any refactoring I had
     done to verify that no new flags showed up on the report. 
    
    What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might 
    be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
        I used google to find forums or youtube videos that helped me
     get past areas I was confused or stuck on. I also used old zybooks
     from past classes that refreshed fundmentals of coding if I felt I 
     was having an issue with adding or implmenting code. The class also
     had valuble weekly readings that would also help going forward.
    
    Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully 
    completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you 
    show future employers from this assignment?
        I would show them my ability to implment a static testing tool to find
     vulnerabilities and my ability to read the errors and come with a plan to
     fix the errors in an organized report.
